All the datas used are from "www.basketball-reference.com".
I scraped the MVP results, per game stats, advanced stats and team stats for each year going back to 1977, year of the NBA-ABA merger.
With these datas, the goal was to create a Machine Learning Model that predict the deserving MVP for each season. 
I used a Random Forest Regressor to predict the share of the voting each player received each year.
The result are showcased in a interactive dashboard created with Dash.
